# Download SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)

[!INCLUDE[appliesto-ss-asdb-asdw-xxx-md](../includes/appliesto-ss-asdb-asdw-pdw-md.md)]

SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) is an integrated environment for managing any SQL infrastructure, from SQL Server to Azure SQL Database. SSMS provides tools to configure, monitor, and administer instances of SQL Server and databases. Use SSMS to deploy, monitor, and upgrade the data-tier components used by your applications, as well as build queries and scripts.

Use SSMS to query, design, and manage your databases and data warehouses, wherever they are - on your local computer, or in the cloud.

SSMS is free!

## Download SSMS 18.1

**SSMS 18.1 is now available, and is the latest general availability (GA) version of *SQL Server Management Studio* that provides support for [!INCLUDE[sql-server-2019](../includes/sssqlv15-md.md)]!**

**[![download](../ssdt/media/download.png) Download SQL Server Management Studio 18.1 ](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2094583)**

SSMS 18.1 is the latest general availability (GA) version of SSMS. If you have SSMS 18.0 (GA) installed, installing SSMS 18.1 upgrades it to 18.1. If you have an older *preview* version of SSMS 18.0 installed, you must uninstall it before installing SSMS 18.1.

**Version Information**

- Release number: 18.1<br>
- Build number: 15.0.18131.0<br>
- Release date: June 11, 2019

If you have comments or suggestions, or you want to report issues, the best way to reach out to the SSMS Team is at [UserVoice](https://aka.ms/sqlfeedback).

The SSMS 18.x installation does not upgrade or replace SSMS versions 17.x or earlier. SSMS 18.x installs side by side with previous versions so both versions are available for use.

If a computer contains side by side installations of SSMS, verify you start the correct version for your specific needs. The latest version is labeled **Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio 18**

## Supported SQL offerings (SSMS 18.1)

* This version of SSMS works with all [supported versions of SQL Server 2008 - [!INCLUDE[sql-server-2019](../includes/sssqlv15-md.md)]](https://support.microsoft.com/lifecycle?C2=1044) and provides the greatest level of support for working with the latest cloud features in Azure SQL Database and Azure SQL Data Warehouse.
* Additionally, SSMS 18.x can be installed side by side with SSMS 17.x, SSMS 16.x, or SQL Server 2014 SSMS and earlier.
* SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) - SSMS version 17.x or later does not support connecting to the legacy SQL Server Integration Services service. To connect to an earlier version of the legacy Integration Services, use the version of SSMS aligned with the version of SQL Server. For example, use SSMS 16.x to connect to the legacy SQL Server 2016 Integration Services service. SSMS 17.x and SSMS 16.x can be installed side-by-side on the same computer. Since the release of SQL Server 2012, the SSIS Catalog database, SSISDB, is the recommended way to store, manage, run, and monitor Integration Services packages. For details, see [SSIS Catalog](../integration-services/catalog/ssis-catalog.md).
