# SQL Assessment API (Public Preview)

SQL Assessment API provides a mechanism to evaluate the configuration of your SQL Server for best practices. The API is delivered with a ruleset containing best practice rules suggested by SQL Server Team. This ruleset will be enhancing with the release of new versions but at the same time, the API is built with the intent to give a highly customizable and extensible solution. So, users can tune the default rules and create their own ones.

SQL Assessment API is useful when you want to make sure your SQL Server configuration is in line with recommended best practices. After an initial assessment, configuration stability can be tracked by regularly scheduled assessments.

The API can be used to assess SQL Server versions 2012 and higher. Both SQL on Windows and SQL on Linux are supported, but the current version's ruleset is for SQL on Windows only.

## Rules

Rules sometimes referred to as checks, are defined in JSON formatted files. Microsoft's shipped ruleset is available on GitHub. You can visit the [samples repository](https://aka.ms/sql-assessment-api) for more details.

## SQL Assessment cmdlets and SMO extension

SQL Assessment API is part of the [SQL Server Management Objects (SMO)](../relational-databases/server-management-objects-smo/installing-smo.md) July 2019 release version and higher and the [SQL Server PowerShell module](../powershell/download-sql-server-ps-module.md) July 2019 release version and higher.

* [Install SMO](../relational-databases/server-management-objects-smo/installing-smo.md)

* [Install SQL Server PowerShell module](../powershell/download-sql-server-ps-module.md)

SqlServer module is getting two new cmdlets to work with SQL Assessment API:

* **Get-SqlAssessmentItem** – Provides a list of available assessment checks for a SQL Server object

* **Invoke-SqlAssessment** – Provides results of an assessment

SMO Framework is supplemented by the SQL Assessment API extension that provides the following methods:

* **GetAssessmentItems** – Returns available checks for a particular SQL object (IEnumerable<…>)

* **GetAssessmentResults** – Synchronously evaluates assessment and returns results and errors if any (IEnumerable<…>)

* **GetAssessmentResultsList** – Asynchronously evaluates assessment and returns results and errors if any (Task<…>)

## Get started using SQL Assessment cmdlets

An assessment is performed against a chosen SQL Server object. In the default ruleset, there are checks for two kinds of objects only: Server and Database (in addition to them, the API supports two more kinds: Filegroup and AvailabilityGroup). If you want to assess a SQL instance and all its databases, you should run the SQL Assessment cmdlets for each object separately. Or you can pass objects for assessment to the SQL Assessment cmdlets in a variable or the pipeline.

Go through the examples below to get started.

1. Get a list of available checks for the local instance to familiarize yourself with the checks. In this example, we're using a path implemented with the [Windows PowerShell SQL Server provider](../powershell/sql-server-powershell-provider.md) to pass the instance object to the Get-SqlAssessmentItem cmdlet.

    ```powershell
    CD SQLSERVER:\SQL\localhost\default
    Get-SqlAssessmentItem
    ```

2. Get a list of available checks for all databases of the instance. Here, we're putting the output of the Get-SqlDatabase cmdlet into a variable so further get Get-SqlAssessmentItem results for each database.

    ```powershell
    $databases = Get-SqlDatabase -ServerInstance 'localhost'
    Get-SqlAssessmentItem $databases
    ```

3. Invoke assessment for the instance and save the results to a SQL table. In this example, we're piping the output of the Get-SqlInstance cmdlet to the Invoke-SqlAssessment cmdlet, which results are piped to the Write-SqlTableData cmdlet.

    ```powershell
    Get-SqlInstance -ServerInstance 'localhost' |
    Invoke-SqlAssessment |
    Write-SqlTableData -ServerInstance 'localhost' -DatabaseName SQLAssessmentDemo -SchemaName Assessment -TableName Results -Force
    ```

4. Invoke assessment for the databases and save the results to the same table. In this example, we're using the Get-SqlDatabase cmdlet to pass all databases to the Invoke-SqlAssessment cmdlet.

    ```powershell
    Get-SqlDatabase -ServerInstance 'localhost' |
    Invoke-SqlAssessment |
    Write-SqlTableData -ServerInstance 'localhost' -DatabaseName SQLAssessmentDemo -SchemaName Assessment -TableName Results -Force
    ```

5. Follow descriptions and links in the table to further understand the recommendations.

6. Customize the rules based on your environment and organizational requirements (see below).

7. Schedule a task or a job to run the assessment regularly or on-demand to measure progress.

## Customizing rules

Rules are designed to be customizable and extensible. Microsoft's ruleset is designed to work for most environments. However, it's impossible to have one ruleset that works for every single environment. Users can write their own JSON files and customize existing rules or add new ones. Examples of customization and complete Microsoft released ruleset are available in the [samples repository](https://aka.ms/sql-assessment-api). For more details on how to run the SQL Assessment cmdlets with custom JSON files, use the Get-Help cmdlet.

### Options available with rule customization feature

#### Enabling/disabling certain rules or groups of rules (using tags)

You can silence specific rules when they aren't applied to your environment or until scheduled work is done to rectify the issue.

#### Changing threshold parameters

Specific rules have thresholds that are compared against the current value of a metric to find out an issue. If the default thresholds don't fit, you can change them.

#### Adding more rules written by you or third parties

You can string together rulesets by adding one or more JSON files as parameters to your SQL Assessment API call. Your organization might write those files or obtain them from a third party. For example, you can have your JSON file that disables specific rules from the Microsoft ruleset, and another JSON file by an industry expert that include rules you find useful for your environment, followed by another JSON file that changes some threshold values in that JSON file.
