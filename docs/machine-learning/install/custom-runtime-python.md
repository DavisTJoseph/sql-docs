# Install a Python custom runtime for SQL Server
[!INCLUDE [SQL Server 2019 and later](../../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver2019.md)]

This article describes how to install a custom runtime for running Python scripts with SQL Server. The custom runtime for Python can be used in the following scenarios:

+ An installation of SQL Server with extensibility framework.

+ An installation of Machine Learning Services with SQL Server 2019. The language extension can be used with [SQL Server Machine Learning Services](../sql-server-machine-learning-services.md) after completing some additional configuration steps.

> [!NOTE]
> This article describes how to install a custom runtime for Python on Windows. To install on Linux, see [Install a Python custom runtime for SQL Server on Linux](custom-runtime-python.md?view=sql-server-linux-ver15&preserve-view=true).

## Pre-install checklist

Before installing a Python custom runtime, install the following:

+ [SQL Server 2019 for Windows CU3 or later](../../database-engine/install-windows/install-sql-server.md).

  > [!NOTE]
  > Python custom runtime requires Cumulative Update (CU) 3 or later for SQL Server 2019.

+ [SQL Server Language Extensions on Windows with the extensibility framework](../../language-extensions/install/install-sql-server-language-extensions-on-windows.md).

+ [Python 3.7]( https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-379/).

## Add SQL Server Language Extensions for Windows

> [!NOTE]
> If you have Machine Learning Services installed on SQL Server 2019, the extensibility framework is already installed and you can skip this step.

Language Extensions use the extensibility framework for executing external code. Code execution is isolated from the core engine processes, but fully integrated with SQL Server query execution.

1. Start the setup wizard for SQL Server 2019.
  
1. On the **Installation** tab, select **New SQL Server stand-alone installation or add features to an existing installation**.
    
    ![SQL Server 2019 installation CU3 or later](../install/media/2019setup-installation-page-mlsvcs.png) 

1. On the **Feature Selection** page, select these options:
  
    - **Database Engine Services**
  
        To use Language Extensions with SQL Server, you must install an instance of the database engine. You can use either a default or a named instance.
  
    - **Machine Learning Services and Language Extensions**
   
       Select **Machine Learning Services and Language Extensions**. There's no need to select Python.

    ![SQL Server 2019 CU3 or later installation features](../install/media/sql-feature-selection.png) 

1. On the **Ready to Install** page, verify that these selections are included, and select **Install**.
  
    + Database Engine Services
    + Machine Learning Services and Language Extensions

1. After setup is complete, if you're instructed to restart the computer, do so now. It's important to read the message from the Installation Wizard when you've finished with Setup. For more information, see [View and Read SQL Server Setup Log Files](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/database-engine/install-windows/view-and-read-sql-server-setup-log-files).


## Install Python 3.7 

Install [Python 3.7]( https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-379/) and add it to the PATH.

![Add Python 3.7 to path.](../install/media/python-379.png) **update image - note**


#### Install pandas

Install the [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) package for Python from an *elevated* command prompt:

```bash
python.exe -m pip install pandas
```

## Update the system environment variables

Add or modify PYTHONHOME as a system environment variable.

+ In the Windows search box, type "environment" and select **Edit the system environment variables**.
+ In the **Advanced** tab, select **Environment Variables**.
+ Under **System variables**, select **New** to create PYTHONHOME to point to the Python 3.7 installation location.
If PYTHONHOME already exists, select **Edit** to point it to the Python 3.7 installation location.
+ Select **OK** to close remaining windows.

![Create PYTHONHOME system variable.](../install/media/sys-pythonhome.png)

## Grant access to the custom Python installation folder

Run the following **icacls** commands from a new *elevated* command prompt to grant READ & EXECUTE access to PYTHONHOME to **SQL Server Launchpad Service** and SID **S-1-15-2-1** (**ALL_APPLICATION_PACKAGES**). The launchpad service username is of the form `NT Service\MSSQLLAUNCHPAD$INSTANCENAME* where INSTANCENAME` is the instance name of your SQL Server. The commands will recursively grant access to all files and folders under the given directory path.

Append the instance name to `MSSQLLAUNCHPAD` (`MSSQLLAUNCHPAD$INSTANCENAME`). In this example, INSTANCENAME is the default instance `MSSQLSERVER`.

1. Give permissions to **SQL Server Launchpad Service user name**.

    ```cmd
    icacls "%PYTHONHOME%" /grant "NT Service\MSSQLLAUNCHPAD$MSSQLSERVER":(OI)(CI)RX /T

2. Give permissions to **SID S-1-15-2-1**.
    ```cmd
    icacls "%PYTHONHOME%" /grant *S-1-15-2-1:(OI)(CI)RX /T
    
>[!NOTE]
>The preceding command grants permissions to the computer **SID S-1-15-2-1**, which is equivalent to ALL APPLICATION PACKAGES on an English version of Windows. Alternatively, you can use `icacls "%R_HOME%" /grant "ALL APPLICATION PACKAGES":(OI)(CI)RX /T` on an English version of Windows.

## Restart SQL Server Launchpad service

From an *elevated* command prompt, run the following commands. Replace "MSSQLSERVER" with the name of your SQL Server instance.

```CMD
net stop MSSQLLAUNCHPAD$MSSQLSERVER
net start MSSQLLAUNCHPAD$MSSQLSERVER
```

Alternatively, right-click the SQL Server Launchpad service in the **Services** app of the system and click the **Restart** command. Or use [SQL Server Configuration Manager](../../relational-databases/sql-server-configuration-manager.md) to restart the service.

## Download Python language extension

Download the zip file containing the Python language extension, [python-lang-extension.zip](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2143952).

## Register external language

Register this Python language extension with [CREATE EXTERNAL LANGUAGE](../../t-sql/statements/create-external-language-transact-sql.md) for each database you want to use it in. Use [Azure Data Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/azure-data-studio/download-azure-data-studio) to connect to SQL Server and run the following T-SQL command. Modify the path in this statement to reflect the location of the downloaded language extension zip file (python-lang-extension.zip).

> [!NOTE]
> Python is a reserved word. Use a different name for the external language, for example, "myPython".

```sql
CREATE EXTERNAL LANGUAGE [myPython]
FROM (CONTENT = N'/path/to/python-lang-extension.zip', FILE_NAME = 'pythonextension.dll');
GO
```

You can install SQL Server on Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES), and Ubuntu. For more information, see [the Supported platforms section in the Installation guidance for SQL Server on Linux](../../linux/sql-server-linux-setup.md).

> [!NOTE]
> This article describes how to install a custom runtime for Python on Linux. To install on Windows, see the [Install a Python custom runtime for SQL Server on Windows](custom-runtime-python.md?view=sql-server-ver15&preserve-view=true)

## Pre-install checklist

Before installing a Python custom runtime, install the following:

+ [SQL Server 2019 for Linux (Cumulative Update 3 or later)](../../linux/sql-server-linux-setup.md).
When you install SQL Server on Linux, you must configure a Microsoft repository. For more information, see [configuring repositories](../../linux/sql-server-linux-change-repo.md)

  > [!NOTE]
  > Python custom runtime requires Cumulative Update (CU) 3 or later for SQL Server 2019.

+ [SQL Server Language Extensions on Linux with the extensibility framework](../../linux/sql-server-linux-setup-language-extensions.md).

+ [Python 3.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-379/).

## Add SQL Server Language Extensions for Linux

> [!NOTE]
> If you have Machine Learning Services installed on SQL Server 2019, the **mssql-server-extensibility** package for language extensions is already installed and you can skip this step.

Language Extensions use the extensibility framework for executing external code. Code execution is isolated from the core engine processes, but fully integrated with SQL Server query execution.

Use the following commands to install Language Extensions, depending on your version of Linux.

### Ubuntu
> [!TIP]
> If possible, `update` to refresh packages on the system prior to installation. Ubuntu might not have the https apt transport option. To install it, use `apt-get install apt-transport-https`.

```bash
# Install as root or sudo
sudo apt-get install mssql-server-extensibility
```

### Red Hat
```bash
# Install as root or sudo
sudo yum install mssql-server-extensibility
```

### Suse
```bash
# Install as root or sudo
sudo zypper install mssql-server-extensibility
```

## Install Python 3.7 and pandas

Install Python 3.7, the libpython3.7 library, and the pandas package. 

The following are example commands for Ubuntu:

```bash
# Install python3.7 and the corresponding library:
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python3.7 python3-pip libpython3.7

# Install pandas to /usr/lib:
sudo python3.7 -m pip install pandas -t /usr/lib/python3.7/dist-packages
```

## Using a custom installation of Python 3.7

> [!NOTE]
> If you have installed Python in the default location of `/usr/lib/python3.7`, you can skip to [the next section](#download-python-linux).

If you built your own version of Python 3.7, use the following commands so that SQL Server can find and load your custom installation.

### Update the environment variables

1. Edit the mssql-launchpadd service to add the PYTHONHOME environment variable to the file `/etc/systemd/system/mssql-launchpadd.service.d/override.conf`

      ```bash
      sudo systemctl edit mssql-launchpadd
      ```

    + Insert the following text in the `/etc/systemd/system/mssql-launchpadd.service.d/override.conf` file that opens. Set value of PYTHONHOME to the custom Python installation path.

      ```vi
      [Service]
      Environment="PYTHONHOME=/path/to/installation/of/python3.7"
      ```

    + Save and close.

2. Make sure `libpython3.7m.so.1.0` can be loaded.

    + Create a custom-python.conf file in `/etc/ld.so.conf.d`.

      ```bash
      sudo vi /etc/ld.so.conf.d/custom-python.conf
      ```

    + In the file that opens, add the path to **libpython3.7m.so.1.0** from the custom Python installation.

      ```vi
      /path/to/installation/of/python3.7/lib
      ```

    + Save and close the new file.

    + Run `ldconfig` and verify `libpython3.7m.so.1.0` can be loaded by running the following commands and checking that all the dependent libraries can be found.

      ```bash
      sudo ldconfig
      ldd /path/to/installation/of/python3.7/lib/libpython3.7m.so.1.0
      ```

### Grant access to the custom Python folder

Set the `datadirectories` option in the extensibility section of /var/opt/mssql/mssql.conf file to the custom python installation.

```bash
sudo /opt/mssql/bin/mssql-conf set extensibility.datadirectories /path/to/installation/of/python3.7
```

### Restart the mssql-launchpadd service

```bash
sudo systemctl restart mssql-launchpadd
```
## <a name="download-python-linux"></a> Download Python language extension

Download the zip file containing the Python language extension, [python-lang-extension.zip](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2143793).

## Register external language

Register this Python language extension with [CREATE EXTERNAL LANGUAGE](../../t-sql/statements/create-external-language-transact-sql.md) for each database you want to use it in. Use [Azure Data Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/azure-data-studio/download-azure-data-studio) to connect to SQL Server and run the following T-SQL command. 
Modify the path in this statement to reflect the location of the downloaded language extension zip file (python-lang-extension.zip).

> [!NOTE]
>Python is a reserved word. Use a different name for the external language, for example, "myPython".

```sql
CREATE EXTERNAL LANGUAGE myPython 
FROM (CONTENT = N'/PATH/TO/python-lang-extension.zip', FILE_NAME = 'libPythonExtension.so.1.0');
GO
```

::: moniker-end

## Enable external script execution in SQL Server

An external script in Python can be executed via the stored procedure [sp_execute_external script](../../relational-databases/system-stored-procedures/sp-execute-external-script-transact-sql.md) run against SQL Server. 

To enable external scripts, execute the following SQL commands using [Azure Data Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/azure-data-studio/download-azure-data-studio), connected to SQL Server.

```sql
sp_configure 'external scripts enabled', 1;
RECONFIGURE WITH OVERRIDE;  
```

## Verify language extension installation

This SQL script tests the functionality of the installed language extension.

```sql
EXEC sp_execute_external_script
@language =N'myPython',
@script=N'
import sys
print(sys.path)
print(sys.version)
print(sys.executable)'
```

## Verify parameters and datasets of different data types

This script tests different data types for input/output parameters and datasets.

```sql
DECLARE @sumVal int = 12;
DECLARE @charVal VARCHAR(30) = N'Hello'

EXEC sp_execute_external_script
@language =N'myPython',
@script=N'
print(sumVal)
print(charVal)
sumVal = sumVal + 300
OutputDataSet = InputDataSet'
,@input_data_1 = N'SELECT 1, CAST(1.4 as real), ''Hi'', CAST(''1'' as bit)'
,@params = N'@sumVal int OUTPUT, @charVal VARCHAR(30)'
,@sumVal = @sumVal OUTPUT
,@charVal = @charVal
WITH RESULT SETS ((intCol int, doubleCol real, charCol char(2), logicalCol bit));

PRINT @sumVal
```
