# Previous versions of SQL Server documentation

The documentation for several older versions of Microsoft SQL Server has been archived. Yet the archived documentation remains available at:

- [A direct link to previous versions of SQL Server documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/sql/).

> [!TIP]
> Use the [Versioning drop-down list control](../sql-server/versioning-system-monikers-ui-sql-server.md) to select the version of SQL Server you want to see documentation for. The control is available near the top of this webpage.
>
> In the dropdown list, the value labeled **SQL Server previous versions** allows this article to be displayed. This version value also hides most other articles. Almost every other version value hides this article.
>
> The documentation for a _newer_ version of SQL Server is available [here](../sql-server/index.yml?view=sql-server-2017).
