# SqlClient driver support lifecycle

[!INCLUDE[Driver_ADONET_Download](../../includes/driver_adonet_download.md)]

Microsoft.Data.SqlClient library follows the latest .NET Core support policy for all releases.

[View the .NET Core Support Policy](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/platform/support/policy/dotnet-core)

## Microsoft.Data.SqlClient release cadence

New stable (GA) releases will be published every six months on a regular cadence beginning with version 1.2, along with 2 to 3 preview releases in between. Long Term Support (LTS) releases will be chosen by stakeholders and maintainers based on a few qualifications and customer response.
