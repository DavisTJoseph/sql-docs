# What are compute pools in a SQL Server 2019 big data cluster?

This article describes the role of *SQL Server compute pools* in a SQL Server 2019 preview big data cluster. Compute pools provide scale-out computational resources for a big data cluster. The following sections describe the architecture and functionality of a compute pool.

## Compute pool architecture

A compute pool is made of one or more compute pods running in Kubernetes. The automated creation and management of these pods is coordinated by the [SQL Server master instance](concept-master-instance.md). Each pod contains a set of base services and an instance of the SQL Server database engine.

> [!NOTE]
> CTP 2.2 only supports a single compute pool per cluster.

## Scale-out groups

A compute pool can act as a PolyBase scale-out group for distributed queries over different data sources--such as HDFS, Oracle, MongoDB, or Terradata. By using compute pods in Kubernetes, big data clusters can automate creating and configuring compute pods for PolyBase scale-out groups.
