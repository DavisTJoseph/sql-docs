# How to upgrade [!INCLUDE[big-data-clusters-2019](../includes/ssbigdataclusters-ss-nover.md)]

This article provides guidance on how to upgrade a SQL Server big data cluster to a new release. The steps in this article specifically apply to how to upgrade between preview releases.

## Backup and delete the old cluster

Currently, the only way to upgrade a big data cluster to a new release is to manually remove and recreate the cluster. Each release has a unique version of `azdata` that is not compatible with the previous version. Also, if an older cluster had to download an image on a new node, the latest image might not be compatible with the older images on the cluster. To upgrade to the latest release, use the following steps:

1. Before deleting the old cluster, back up the data on the SQL Server master instance and on HDFS. For the SQL Server master instance, you can use [SQL Server backup and restore](data-ingestion-restore-database.md). For HDFS, you [can copy out the data with `curl`](data-ingestion-curl.md).

1. Delete the old cluster with the `azdata delete cluster` command.

   ```bash
    azdata bdc delete --name <old-cluster-name>
   ```

   > [!Important]
   > Use the version of `azdata` that matches your cluster. Do not delete an older cluster with the newer version of `azdata`.

1. Prior to CTP 3.2, `azdata` was called `mssqlctl`. If you have any previous releases of `mssqlctl` or `azdata` installed, it is important to uninstall first before installing the latest version of `azdata`.

   For CTP 2.3 or higher, run the following command. Replace `ctp3.1` in the command with the version of `mssqlctl` that you are uninstalling. If the version is prior to CTP 3.1, add a dash before the version number (for example, `ctp-2.5`).

   ```powershell
   pip3 uninstall -r https://aka.ms/azdata
   ```

1. Install the latest version of `azdata`. The following commands install `azdata` for the release candidate:

   **Windows:**

   ```powershell
   pip3 install -r https://aka.ms/azdata
   ```

   **Linux:**

   ```bash
   pip3 install -r https://aka.ms/azdata --user
   ```

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > For each release, the path to `azdata` changes. Even if you previously installed `azdata` or `mssqlctl`, you must reinstall from the latest path before creating the new cluster.

## <a id="azdataversion"></a> Verify the azdata version

Before deploying a new big data cluster, verify that you are using the latest version of `azdata` with the `--version` parameter:

```bash
azdata --version
```

## Install the new release

After removing the previous big data cluster and installing the latest `azdata`, deploy the new big data cluster by using the current deployment instructions. For more information, see [How to deploy [!INCLUDE[big-data-clusters-2019](../includes/ssbigdataclusters-ss-nover.md)] on Kubernetes](deployment-guidance.md). Then, restore any required databases or files.
