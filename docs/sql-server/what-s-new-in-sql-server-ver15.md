See [`sys.dm_os_wait_stats`](../relational-databases/system-dynamic-management-views/sys-dm-os-wait-stats-transact-sql.md).|
|Custom capture policy for the Query Store|When enabled, additional Query Store configurations are available under a new Query Store Capture Policy setting, to fine-tune data collection in a specific server. For more information, see [ALTER DATABASE SET Options](../t-sql/statements/alter-database-transact-sql-set-options.md).|
|`LIGHTWEIGHT_QUERY_PROFILING`|New database scoped configuration. See [`LIGHTWEIGHT_QUERY_PROFILING`](../t-sql/statements/alter-database-scoped-configuration-transact-sql.md#lqp). |
|`sys.dm_exec_requests` column `command` | Shows `SELECT (STATMAN)` if a `SELECT` is waiting for a synchronous statistics update operation to complete prior to continuing query execution. See [`sys.dm_exec_requests`](../relational-databases/system-dynamic-management-views/sys-dm-exec-requests-transact-sql.md).|
|`sys.dm_exec_query_plan_stats` |New DMF returns the equivalent of the last known actual execution plan for most queries. See [sys.dm_exec_query_plan_stats](../relational-databases/system-dynamic-management-views/sys-dm-exec-query-plan-stats-transact-sql.md).|

The new SRIDs are:<br/><br/> - 7843 for geographic 2D<br/> - 7844 for geographic 3D <br/><br/>[sys.spatial_reference_systems](../relational-databases/system-catalog-views/sys-spatial-reference-systems-transact-sql.md) view contains definitions of new SRIDs. |
| &nbsp; | &nbsp; |

### Performance

|New feature or update | Details |
|:---|:---|
|Accelerated database recovery | Enable accelerated database recovery per-database. See [Accelerated database recovery](../relational-databases/backup-restore/restore-and-recovery-overview-sql-server.md#adr).|
|Forcing fast forward and static cursors | Query Store plan forcing support for fast forward and static cursors. See [Plan forcing support for fast forward and static cursors](../relational-databases/performance/monitoring-performance-by-using-the-query-store.md#ctp23).|
|Resource governance| The configurable value for the `REQUEST_MAX_MEMORY_GRANT_PERCENT` option of `CREATE WORKLOAD GROUP` and `ALTER WORKLOAD GROUP` has been changed from an integer to a float data type, to allow more granular control of memory limits. See [ALTER WORKLOAD GROUP](../t-sql/statements/alter-workload-group-transact-sql.md) and [CREATE WORKLOAD GROUP](../t-sql/statements/create-workload-group-transact-sql.md).|
|Reduced recompilations for workloads| Improves using temporary tables across multiple scopes. See [Reduced recompilations for workloads](../relational-databases/tables/tables.md#ctp23) |
|Indirect checkpoint scalability |See [Improved indirect checkpoint scalability](../relational-databases/logs/database-checkpoints-sql-server.md#ctp23).|
|Memory-optimized `tempdb` metadata| [!INCLUDE[sql-server-2019](../includes/sssqlv15-md.md)] introduces a new feature that is part of the [In-Memory Database](../relational-databases/in-memory-database.md) feature family, memory-optimized `tempdb` metadata, which effectively removes this bottleneck and unlocks a new level of scalability for `tempdb` heavy workloads. In [!INCLUDE[sql-server-2019](../includes/sssqlv15-md.md)], the system tables involved in managing temp table metadata can be moved into latch-free non-durable memory-optimized tables. See [Memory-Optimized `tempdb` Metadata](../relational-databases/databases/tempdb-database.md#memory-optimized-tempdb-metadata).|
|Concurrent PFS updates|[PFS pages](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/SQL-Server/Under-the-covers-GAM-SGAM-and-PFS-pages/ba-p/383125) are special pages within a database file that SQL Server uses to help locate free space when allocating space for an object. Page latch contention on PFS pages is something that is commonly associated with [`tempdb`](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2154845/recommendations-to-reduce-allocation-contention-in-sql-server-tempdb-d), but it can also occur on user databases when there are many concurrent object allocation threads. This improvement changes the way that concurrency is managed with PFS updates so that they can be updated under a shared latch, rather than an exclusive latch. This behavior is on by default in all databases (including `tempdb`) starting with [!INCLUDE[sql-server-2019](../includes/sssqlv15-md.md)].|
|Row mode memory grant feedback |Expands on the batch mode memory grant feedback feature by adjusting memory grant sizes for both batch and row mode operators. This can automatically correct excessive grants that result in wasted memory and reduced concurrency, and correct insufficient memory grants that cause expensive spills to disk. See [Row mode memory grant feedback](../relational-databases/performance/intelligent-query-processing.md#row-mode-memory-grant-feedback). |
|Table variable deferred compilation|Improves plan quality and overall performance for queries that reference table variables. During optimization and initial compilation, this feature propagates cardinality estimates that are based on actual table variable row counts. This accurate row count information optimizes downstream plan operations. See [Table variable deferred compilation](../relational-databases/performance/intelligent-query-processing.md#table-variable-deferred-compilation). |
|`APPROX_COUNT_DISTINCT `|For scenarios when absolute precision isn't important, but responsiveness is critical, `APPROX_COUNT_DISTINCT` aggregates across large datasets using less resources than `COUNT(DISTINCT())` for superior concurrency. See [Approximate query processing](../relational-databases/performance/intelligent-query-processing.md#approximate-query-processing).|
|Batch mode on rowstore|Batch mode on rowstore enables batch mode execution without requiring columnstore indexes. Batch mode execution uses CPU more efficiently during analytical workloads, but until [!INCLUDE[sql-server-2019](../includes/sssqlv15-md.md)] it was only used when a query included operations with columnstore indexes. However, some applications may use features that aren't supported with columnstore indexes, and therefore could not leverage batch mode. Starting with [!INCLUDE[sql-server-2019](../includes/sssqlv15-md.md)], batch mode is enabled on eligible analytical workloads whose queries include operations with any type of index (rowstore or columnstore). See [Batch mode on rowstore](../relational-databases/performance/intelligent-query-processing.md#batch-mode-on-rowstore). |
|Scalar UDF Inlining|Automatically transforms scalar UDFs into relational expressions and embeds them in the calling SQL query. This transformation improves the performance of workloads that take advantage of scalar UDFs. See [Scalar UDF Inlining](../relational-databases/performance/intelligent-query-processing.md#scalar-udf-inlining).|
| &nbsp; | &nbsp; |

### Availability groups

|New feature or update | Details |
|:---|:---|
|Up to five synchronous replicas|[!INCLUDE[sql-server-2019](../includes/sssqlv15-md.md)] increases the maximum number of synchronous replicas to 5, up from 3 in [!INCLUDE[ssSQL17](../includes/sssql17-md.md)]. You can configure this group of five replicas to have automatic failover within the group. There is one primary replica, plus four synchronous secondary replicas.|
|Secondary-to-primary replica connection redirection| Allows client application connections to be directed to the primary replica regardless of the target server specified in the connection string. For details, see [Secondary to primary replica read/write connection redirection (Always On Availability Groups)](../database-engine/availability-groups/windows/secondary-replica-connection-redirection-always-on-availability-groups.md).|
| &nbsp; | &nbsp; |

### Setup 

|New feature or update | Details | 
|:---|:---| 
|New memory setup options | Sets the *min server memory (MB)* and *max server memory (MB)* server configurations during installation. For more information, see [Database Engine Configuration - Memory page](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/sql-server/install/instance-configuration?view=sql-server-ver15#memory) and the `USESQLRECOMMENDEDMEMORYLIMITS`, `SQLMINMEMORY`, and `SQLMAXMEMORY` parameters in [Install SQL Server from the Command Prompt](../database-engine/install-windows/install-sql-server-from-the-command-prompt.md#Install). The proposed value will align with the memory configuration guidelines in [Server Memory Configuration Options](../database-engine/configure-windows/server-memory-server-configuration-options.md#setting-the-memory-options-manually).| 
|New parallelism setup options | Sets the *max degree of parallelism* server configuration during installation. For more information, see [Database Engine Configuration - MaxDOP page](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/sql-server/install/instance-configuration?view=sql-server-ver15#maxdop) and the `SQLMAXDOP` parameter in [Install SQL Server from the Command Prompt](../database-engine/install-windows/install-sql-server-from-the-command-prompt.md#Install). The default value will align with the max degree of parallelism guidelines in [Configure the max degree of parallelism Server Configuration Option](../database-engine/configure-windows/configure-the-max-degree-of-parallelism-server-configuration-option.md#Guidelines).| 
| &nbsp; | &nbsp; |

### Error messages

|New feature or update | Details |
|:---|:---|
|Verbose truncation warnings | Truncation error message defaults to include table and column names, and truncated value. See [VERBOSE_TRUNCATION_WARNINGS](../t-sql/statements/alter-database-scoped-configuration-transact-sql.md#verbose-truncation).|
