# Configure Always Encrypted with secure enclaves

[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-ssver15-xxxx-xxxx-xxx](../../../includes/tsql-appliesto-ssver15-xxxx-xxxx-xxx.md)]

[Always Encrypted with secure enclaves](always-encrypted-enclaves.md) extends the existing [Always Encrypted](always-encrypted-database-engine.md) feature to enable richer functionality on sensitive data while keeping the data confidential.

To set up Always Encrypted with secure enclaves, use the following workflow:

1. Configure Host Guardian Service (HGS) attestation.
2. Install [!INCLUDE[sql-server-2019](../../../includes/sssqlv15-md.md)] on the SQL Server computer.
3. Install tools on the client/development computer.
4. Configure the enclave type in your SQL Server instance.
5. Provision enclave-enabled keys.
6. Encrypt columns that contain sensitive data.

[!INCLUDE[freshInclude](../../../includes/paragraph-content/fresh-note-steps-feedback.md)]

> [!NOTE]
> For a step-by-step tutorial on how to set up a test environment and try the functionality of Always Encrypted with secure enclaves in SSMS, see [Tutorial: Getting started with Always Encrypted with secure enclaves using SSMS](../tutorial-getting-started-with-always-encrypted-enclaves.md).

## Configure your environment

To use secure enclaves with Always Encrypted, your environment requires Windows Server 2019 Preview, and SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) 18.0, .NET Framework, and several other components. The following sections provide details and links to get the required components.

### SQL Server computer requirements

The computer running SQL Server needs the following operating system and SQL Server version:

*SQL Server*:

- [!INCLUDE[sql-server-2019](../../../includes/sssqlv15-md.md)] or later

*Windows*:

- Windows 10 Enterprise, version 1809
- Windows Server DataCenter (Semi-Annual Channel), version 1809
- Windows Server 2019 DataCenter

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The SQL Server computer must be configured as a guarded host, attested by HGS. TPM attestation is the recommended enclave attestation method for production environments, and requires SQL Server runs on a physical machine, not in a virtual machine. Virtual machines are adequate for pre-production environments only.

### HGS computer requirements

A single HGS computer is sufficient during testing and prototyping. For production, a Windows failover cluster with three computers is recommended.

Windows Host Guardian Service (HGS) needs to be installed on separate HGS computers, and not on the same computer as SQL Server. For details on HGS computer requirements and setup, see [Setting up the Host Guardian Service for Always Encrypted in SQL Server](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-server/security/set-up-hgs-for-always-encrypted-in-sql-server).


### Determine your Attestation Service URL

To determine the attestation service URL, you need to configure your tools and applications:

1. Sign in to your SQL Server computer as administrator.
2. Run PowerShell as administrator.
3. Run [Get-HGSClientConfiguration](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/hgsclient/get-hgsclientconfiguration).
4. Write down and save the AttestationServerURL property. It should look similar to this: `https://x.x.x.x/Attestation`.

### Install tools

Install the following tools on the client/development computer:

1. [.NET Framework 4.7.2](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/dotnet-framework-runtime).
2. [SSMS 18.0 or later](../../../ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms.md).
3. [SQL Server PowerShell module](../../../powershell/download-sql-server-ps-module.md) version 21.1 or later.
4. [Visual Studio (2017 or later recommended)](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/).
5. [Developer Pack for .NET Framework 4.7.2](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/visual-studio-sdks).
6. [Microsoft.SqlServer.Management.AlwaysEncrypted.AzureKeyVaultProvider NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.SqlServer.Management.AlwaysEncrypted.AzureKeyVaultProvider), version 2.2.0 or later.
7. [Microsoft.SqlServer.Management.AlwaysEncrypted.EnclaveProviders NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages?q=Microsoft.SqlServer.Management.AlwaysEncrypted.EnclaveProviders).

Use NuGet packages in Visual Studio projects to develop applications using Always Encrypted with secure enclaves. The first package is required only if you store your column master keys in Azure Key Vault. For details, see [Develop applications](#develop-applications-issuing-rich-queries-in-visual-studio).

### Configure a secure enclave

On the client/development computer:

1. Open SSMS and connect to your SQL Server instance as an Active Directory (AD) administrator.
2. To verify Always Encrypted with secure enclaves is supported in your instance, run the following query:

   ```sql
   SELECT [name], [value], [value_in_use] FROM sys.configurations
   WHERE [name] = 'column encryption enclave type';
   ```

    The query should return a row that looks like the following:  

    | name                           | value | value_in_use |
    | ------------------------------ | ----- | -------------|
    | column encryption enclave type | 0     | 0            |

3. Configure the secure enclave type to VBS enclaves.

   ```sql
   EXEC sys.sp_configure 'column encryption enclave type', 1;
   RECONFIGURE;
   ```

4. Restart your SQL Server instance for the previous change to take effect. You can restart the instance in SSMS by right-clicking on it in Object Explorer and selecting Restart. Once the instance restarts, reconnect to it.

5. Confirm the secure enclave is now loaded by running the following query:

   ```sql
   SELECT [name], [value], [value_in_use] FROM sys.configurations
   WHERE [name] = 'column encryption enclave type';
   ```   

    The query should return a row that looks like the following:  

    | name                           | value | value_in_use |
    | ------------------------------ | ----- | -------------- |
    | column encryption enclave type | 1     | 1              |

6. To enable rich computations on encrypted columns, run the following query:

   ```sql
   DBCC traceon(127,-1);
   ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > Rich computations are disabled by default in [!INCLUDE[sql-server-2019](../../../includes/sssqlv15-md.md)]. They need to be enabled using the above statement after each restart of your SQL Server instance.

## Provision enclave-enabled keys

The introduction of enclave-enabled keys doesn't fundamentally change the [key provisioning and key management workflows for Always Encrypted](overview-of-key-management-for-always-encrypted.md). The only change is in the column master key provisioning workflow. You can now mark the key as enclave-enabled By default, column master keys aren't enclave-enabled. When you set the new column master key to enclave-enabled (with SSMS, or PowerShell), the following happens:

- The`ENCLAVE_COMPUTATIONS` property in the column master key metadata in the database is set.
- The column master key property values, including the `ENCLAVE_COMPUTATIONS` setting, are digitally signed. The tool adds the signature, which is produced using the actual column master key, to the metadata. The signature prevents malicious tampering with the `ENCLAVE_COMPUTATIONS` setting. The SQL client drivers verify the signatures before allowing the enclave use. This provides security administrators with control over which column data can be computed inside the enclave.

The `ENCLAVE_COMPUTATIONS` property of a column master key is immutable. You can't change it after the key has been provisioned. You can, however, replace the column master key with a new key that has a different value of the `ENCLAVE_COMPUTATIONS` property than the original key. To replace the column master key, [rotate the column master key](#make-columns-enclave-enabled-by-rotating-their-column-master-key). For more information about the `ENCLAVE_COMPUTATIONS` property, see [CREATE COLUMN MASTER KEY](../../../t-sql/statements/create-column-master-key-transact-sql.md).

To provision an enclave-enabled column encryption key, you need to make sure that the column master key that encrypts the column encryption key, is enclave-enabled.

The following limitations currently apply to provisioning enclave-enabled keys:

- Enclave-enabled column master keys must be stored in [Windows Certificate Store](/windows/desktop/seccrypto/managing-certificates-with-certificate-stores) or in [Azure Key Vault](/azure/key-vault/key-vault-whatis/). Storing enclave-enabled column master keys in other types of key stores, for example hardware security modules or custom key stores, isn't currently supported.

### Provision enclave-enabled keys using SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)

The following steps create enclave-enabled keys (requires SSMS 18.0 or later):

1. Connect to your database using SSMS.
2. In **Object Explorer**, expand your database and navigate to **Security** > **Always Encrypted Keys**.
3. Provision a new enclave-enabled column master key:

    1. Right-click **Always Encrypted Keys** and select **New Column Master Key...**.
    2. Select your column master key name.
    3. Make sure you select either **Windows Certificate Store (Current User or Local Machine)** or **Azure Key Vault**.
    4. Select **Allow enclave computations**.
    5. If you selected Azure Key Vault, sign in to Azure and select your key vault. For more information on how to create a key vault for Always Encrypted, see [Manage your key vaults from Azure portal](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/kv/2016/09/12/manage-your-key-vaults-from-new-azure-portal/).
    6. Select your key if it already exists, or follow the directions on the form to create a new key.
    7. Click **OK**.

        ![Allow enclave computations](./media/always-encrypted-enclaves/allow-enclave-computations.png)

4. Create a new enclave-enabled column encryption key:

    1. Right-click **Always Encrypted Keys** and select **New Column Encryption Key**.
    2. Enter a name for the new column encryption key.
    3. In the **Column master key** dropdown, select the column master key you created in the previous steps.
    4. Click **OK**.

### Provision enclave-enabled keys using PowerShell

The following sections provide sample PowerShell scripts for provisioning enclave-enabled keys. The steps that are specific (new) to Always Encrypted with secure enclaves are highlighted. For more information (not specific to Always Encrypted with secure enclaves) about provisioning keys using PowerShell, see [Configure Always Encrypted Keys using PowerShell](configure-always-encrypted-keys-using-powershell.md).

#### Provisioning enclave-enabled keys - Windows Certificate Store

On the client/development computer, open Windows PowerShell ISE, and run the following script.

Important to note is the use of the `-AllowEnclaveComputations` parameter in the [**New-SqlCertificateStoreColumnMasterKeySettings**](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/sqlserver/new-sqlcertificatestorecolumnmasterkeysettings) cmdlet.

```powershell
# Create a column master key in Windows Certificate Store.
$cert = New-SelfSignedCertificate -Subject "\<Subject Name\>" -CertStoreLocation Cert:CurrentUser\\My -KeyExportPolicy Exportable -Type DocumentEncryptionCert -KeyUsage DataEncipherment -KeySpec KeyExchange

# Import the SqlServer module.
Import-Module "SqlServer"

# Connect to your database. Provide the server/db name. Modify the connection string, if needed.
$serverName = "<server name>"
$databaseName = "<database name>"
$connStr = "Data Source = " + $serverName + "; Initial Catalog = " + $databaseName + "; Integrated Security = true"
$database = Get-SqlDatabase -ConnectionString $connStr

# Create a SqlColumnMasterKeySettings object for your column master key
# using the -AllowEnclaveComputations parameter.
$cmkSettings = New-SqlCertificateStoreColumnMasterKeySettings -CertificateStoreLocation "CurrentUser" -Thumbprint $cert.Thumbprint -AllowEnclaveComputations

# Create column master key metadata in the database.
$cmkName = "<column master key name in the database>"
New-SqlColumnMasterKey -Name $cmkName -InputObject $database -ColumnMasterKeySettings $cmkSettings

# Generate a column encryption key, encrypt it with the column master key and create column encryption key metadata in the database.
$cekName = "<column encryption key name in the database>"
New-SqlColumnEncryptionKey -Name $cekName -InputObject $database -ColumnMasterKey $cmkName
```

#### Provisioning enclave-enabled keys - Azure Key Vault

On the client/development computer, open Windows PowerShell ISE, and run the following script.

**Step 1: Provision a column master key in Azure Key Vault**

This can be also done using Azure portal. For details, see [Manage your key vaults from Azure portal](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/kv/2016/09/12/manage-your-key-vaults-from-new-azure-portal/).


```powershell
Import-Module Az
Connect-AzAccount

# User values
$SubscriptionId = "<Azure SubscriptionId>"
$resourceGroup = "<resource group name>"
$azureLocation = "<datacenter location>"
$akvName = "<key vault name>"
$akvKeyName = "<key name>"

# Set the context to the specified subscription.
$azureCtx = Set-AzContext -SubscriptionId $SubscriptionId

# Create a new resource group - skip, if your desired group already exists.
New-AzResourceGroup -Name $resourceGroup -Location $azureLocation

# Create a new key vault - skip if your vault already exists.
New-AzKeyVault -VaultName $akvName -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroup -Location $azureLocation

# Grant yourself permissions needed to create and use the column master key.
Set-AzKeyVaultAccessPolicy -VaultName $akvName -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroup -PermissionsToKeys get, create, list, update, wrapKey,unwrapKey, sign, verify -UserPrincipalName $azureCtx.Account

# Create a column master key in Azure Key Vault.
$akvKey = Add-AzureKeyVaultKey -VaultName $akvName -Name $akvKeyName -Destination "Software"
```

**Step 2: Create column master key metadata in the database, create a column encryption key, and create column encryption key metadata in the database**


```powershell
# Import the SqlServer module.
Import-Module "SqlServer" -Version

# Connect to your database. Provide the server and db name. If needed, modify the connection string.
$serverName = "<server name>"
$databaseName = "<database name>"
$connStr = "Data Source = " + $serverName + "; Initial Catalog = " + $databaseName + "; Integrated Security = true"
$database = Get-SqlDatabase -ConnectionString $connStr

# Authenticate to Azure before calling New-SqlAzureKeyVaultColumnMasterKeySettings,
# because -AllowEnclaveComputations causes a call to Azure Key Vault
# to generate the signature of the column master key.
Add-SqlAzureAuthenticationContext -Interactive

# Create a SqlColumnMasterKeySettings object for your column master key.
$cmkSettings = New-SqlAzureKeyVaultColumnMasterKeySettings -KeyURL $akvKey.ID -AllowEnclaveComputations

# Create column master key metadata in the database.
$cmkName = "<column master key name in the database>"
New-SqlColumnMasterKey -Name $cmkName -InputObject $database -ColumnMasterKeySettings $cmkSettings

# Generate a column encryption key, encrypt it with the column master key and create column encryption key metadata in the database.
$cekName = "<column encryption key name in the database>"
New-SqlColumnEncryptionKey -Name $cekName -InputObject $database -ColumnMasterKey $cmkName
```

## Identify enclave-enabled keys and columns

To list column master keys, configured in your database, query the [sys.column_master_keys](../../system-catalog-views/sys-column-master-keys-transact-sql.md) catalog view (for example, in SSMS). The new **allow_enclave_computations** column indicates whether a column master key is enclave-enabled.

```sql
SELECT name, allow_enclave_computations
FROM sys.column_master_keys;
```

When a column encryption key is encrypted with enclave-enabled column encryption keys, it is enclave-enabled. To return enclave-enabled column encryption keys, the following query joins [sys.column_master_keys](../../system-catalog-views/sys-column-master-keys-transact-sql.md), [sys.column_encryption_key_values](../../system-catalog-views/sys-column-encryption-key-values-transact-sql.md), and [sys.column_encryption_keys](../../system-catalog-views/sys-column-encryption-keys-transact-sql.md).

```sql
SELECT cek.name AS [cek_name]
, cmk.name AS [cmk_name]
, cmk.allow_enclave_computations
FROM sys.column_master_keys cmk
JOIN sys.column_encryption_key_values cekv
   ON cmk.column_master_key_id = cekv.column_master_key_id
JOIN sys.column_encryption_keys cek
   ON cekv.column_encryption_key_id = cek.column_encryption_key_id;
```

Columns encrypted with enclave-enabled keys are enclave-enabled. To determine which columns are enclave-enabled, use the following query:

```sql
SELECT c.name AS column_name
, cek.name AS cek_name
, cmk.name AS [cmk_name]
, cmk.allow_enclave_computations
from sys.columns c
JOIN sys.column_encryption_keys cek 
ON c.column_encryption_key_id = cek.column_encryption_key_id 
JOIN sys.column_encryption_key_values cekv 
ON cekv.column_encryption_key_id = cek.column_encryption_key_id 
JOIN sys.column_master_keys cmk 
ON cmk.column_master_key_id = cekv.column_master_key_id;
```

## Manage collations

Always Encrypted restricts collations. Non-BIN2 collations aren't allowed for character string columns encrypted using deterministic encryption. This restriction also applies to enclave-enabled string columns.

The use of non-BIN2 collations is permitted for character string columns encrypted with randomized encryption and enclave-enabled column encryption keys. However, the only new functionality that is enabled for such columns is in-place encryption. To enable rich computations (pattern matching, comparison operations), the encrypted column requires a BIN2 collation.

The below table summarizes the functionality for enclave-enabled string columns, depending on the encryption type and the collation sort order.

| **Collation sort order** | **Deterministic Encryption** | **Randomized Encryption**                 |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Non-BIN2**             | Not supported                | In-place encryption                       |
| **BIN2**                 | Equality comparison          | In-place encryption and rich computations |

### Determining and changing collations

In SQL Server, collations can be set at the server, database, or column level. For general instructions on how to determine the current collation and change a collation at the server, database or column level, see [Collation and Unicode Support](../../collations/collation-and-unicode-support.md).

### Special considerations for non-UNICODE string columns

The following additional restriction, imposed by a limitation in SQL client drivers (not related to Always Encrypted), applies to non-UNICODE (ASCII) string columns. If you overwrite the database collation for a non-UNICODE (char, varchar) string column, you must ensure the column collation uses the same code page as the database collation.
To list all collations along with their code page identifiers, use the following query:

```sql
SELECT [Name]
   , [Description]
   , [CodePage] = COLLATIONPROPERTY([Name], 'CodePage')
FROM ::fn_helpcollations();
```

For example, `Chinese_Traditional_Stroke_Order_100_CI_AI_WS` and `Chinese_Traditional_Stroke_Order_100_BIN2` have the same code page (950), but `Chinese_Traditional_Stroke_Order_100_CI_AI_WS` and `Latin1_General_100_BIN2` have different code pages (950 and 1252, respectively). The above restriction doesn't apply to UNICODE (`nchar`, `nvarchar`) string columns. Consider setting a UNICODE data type for your new encrypted columns that you're creating, or changing the type to a UNICODE type before encrypting an existing column.

## Create a new table with enclave-enabled columns

You can create a new table with encrypted columns using the [CREATE TABLE (Transact-SQL)](../../../t-sql/statements/create-table-transact-sql.md) statement. Always Encrypted with secure enclaves doesn't change the syntax of this statement.

1. Using SSMS, connect to your database and open a query window.

     > [!NOTE]
     > Always Encrypted does not have to be enabled in the connection string for this task.

2. In the query window, issue a `CREATE TABLE` statement to create your new table, specifying the `ENCRYPTED WITH` clause in the [column definition](../../../t-sql/statements/alter-table-column-definition-transact-sql.md) for each column to be encrypted. To make a column enclave-enabled, make sure you specify an enclave-enabled column encryption key. You may also need to specify a BIN2 collation for string columns if the default collation for your database isn't a BIN2 collation. See the Collation Setup section for details.

### Example of creating a new table with enclave-enabled columns

The below statement creates a new table with two encrypted columns, SSN and Salary. Assuming CEK1 is an enclave-enabled column encryption key, the SQL Server Engine supports both in-place encryption and rich computations for both columns, as the columns use randomized encryption. The statement sets Latin1\_General\_BIN2 collation for the UNICODE SSN column, which is required assuming the default database collation is a non-BIN2 Latin1 collation.

```sql
CREATE TABLE [dbo].[Employees]
(
    [EmployeeID] [int] IDENTITY(1,1) NOT NULL,
    [SSN] [char](11) COLLATE Latin1_General_BIN2 ENCRYPTED WITH (
        COLUMN_ENCRYPTION_KEY = [CEK1],
        ENCRYPTION_TYPE = Randomized,
        ALGORITHM = 'AEAD_AES_256_CBC_HMAC_SHA_256') NOT NULL,
    [FirstName] [nvarchar](50) NOT NULL,
    [LastName] [nvarchar](50) NOT NULL,
    [Salary] [money] ENCRYPTED WITH (
        COLUMN_ENCRYPTION_KEY = [CEK1],
        ENCRYPTION_TYPE = Randomized,
        ALGORITHM = 'AEAD_AES_256_CBC_HMAC_SHA_256') NOT NULL,
    CONSTRAINT [PK_dbo.Employees] PRIMARY KEY CLUSTERED (
[EmployeeID] ASC
)
) ON [PRIMARY];
GO
```

## Add a new enclave-enabled column to an existing Table

You can add a new encrypted column to an existing table using the [ALTER TABLE (Transact-SQL)](../../../t-sql/statements/alter-table-transact-sql.md) / ADD statement. Always Encrypted with secure enclaves doesn't change the syntax of this statement.

1. Using SSMS, connect to your database and open a query window.

   Always Encrypted doesn't have to be enabled in the connection string for this task.

2. In the query window, issue the ALTER TABLE statement with the ADD clause, specifying the ENCRYPTED WITH clause in the [column definition](../../../t-sql/statements/alter-table-column-definition-transact-sql.md), and using an enclave-enabled column encryption key. You may also need to specify a BIN2 collation if your new column is a string column and if the default collation for your database isn't a BIN2 collation. See the Collation Setup section for details.

### Example of adding a new enclave-enabled column to an existing Table

Assuming CEK1 is an enclave-enabled column encryption key, the below statement adds a new encrypted column, named BirthDate, which supports both rich queries and in-place encryption (as the column uses Randomized encryption).

```sql
ALTER TABLE [dbo].[Employees]
ADD [BirthDate] [Date] ENCRYPTED WITH (
COLUMN_ENCRYPTION_KEY = [CEK1],
ENCRYPTION_TYPE = Randomized,
ALGORITHM = 'AEAD_AES_256_CBC_HMAC_SHA_256') NULL;
```


## Prepare an SSMS Query Window with Always Encrypted enabled

To add the required connection parameters to enable enclave computations:

1. Open SSMS.
2. After specifying your server name and a database name in the Connect To Server dialog, click **Options**. Navigate to the **Always Encrypted** tab, select **Enable Always Encrypted**, and specify your enclave attestation URL.
    
    ![Column Encryption Setting](./media/always-encrypted-enclaves/column-encryption-setting.png)

3. Click Connect.
4. Open a new query window.

Alternatively, if you already have a query window open, here is how you can update its database connection to enable Always Encrypted:

1. Right-click anywhere in an existing query window.
2. Select Connection \> Change Connection.
3. Click on **Options**. Navigate to the **Always Encrypted** tab, select **Enable Always Encrypted**, and specify your enclave attestation URL.
4. Click Connect.

## Work with encrypted columns

### Encrypt an existing plaintext column in-place

You can encrypt an existing plaintext column in-place using the [ALTER TABLE (Transact-SQL)](../../../t-sql/statements/alter-table-transact-sql.md) / ALTER COLUMN statement, providing you use an enclave-enabled column encryption key.

To encrypt a column using a key that isn't enclave-enabled, you need to use client-side tools, such as the Always Encrypted wizard in SSMS, or the Set-SqlColumnEncryption cmdlet in the SqlServer PowerShell module. For details, see:

- [Always Encrypted Wizard](always-encrypted-wizard.md)
- [Configure Column Encryption using PowerShell](configure-column-encryption-using-powershell.md)


#### Prerequisites for encrypting an existing plaintext column in-place

- Your existing column isn't encrypted.
- You have provisioned enclave-enabled keys.
- You have access to the column master key.

#### Steps for encrypting existing plaintext column in-place

1. Prepare an SSMS query window with Always Encrypted and enclave computations enabled in the database connection. For details, see [Prepare an SSMS Query Window with Always Encrypted Enabled](#prepare-an-ssms-query-window-with-always-encrypted-enabled).
2. In the query window, issue the ALTER TABLE statement with the ALTER COLUMN clause, specifying an enclave-enabled column encryption key in the ENCRYPTED WITH clause. If your column is a string column (for example, char, varchar, nchar, nvarchar), you may also need to change the collation to a BIN2 collation. See the Collation Setup section for details.
    
    > [!NOTE]
    > If your column master key is stored in Azure Key Vault, you might be prompted to sign in to Azure.

3. Clear the plan cache for all batches and stored procedures that access the table, to refresh parameters encryption information. 
 
    ```sql
    ALTER DATABASE SCOPED CONFIGURATION CLEAR PROCEDURE_CACHE;
    ```
    > [!NOTE]
    > If you do not remove the plan for the impacted query from the cache, the first execution of the query after encryption may fail.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Use `ALTER DATABASE SCOPED CONFIGURATION CLEAR PROCEDURE_CACHE` or `DBCC FREEPROCCACHE` to clear the plan cache carefully, as it may result in temporary query performance degradation. To minimize the negative impact of clearing the cache, you can selectively remove the plans for the impacted queries only.

4.  Call [sp_refresh_parameter_encryption](../../system-stored-procedures/sp-refresh-parameter-encryption-transact-sql.md) to update the metadata for the parameters of each module (stored procedure, function, view, trigger) that are persisted in [sys.parameters](../..//system-catalog-views/sys-parameters-transact-sql.md) and may have been invalidated by encrypting the columns.

#### Example of encrypting existing plaintext column in-place

The below example assumes:

- CEK1 is an enclave-enabled column encryption key.

- The SSN column is plaintext and is currently using a Latin1, non-BIN2 collation (for example, Latin1\_General\_CI\_AI\_KS\_WS).

The statement encrypts the SSN column using randomized encryption and enclave-enabled column encryption key. It also overwrites the default database collation with the corresponding (in the same code page) BIN2 collation.

The operation is performed online (ONLINE = ON). Also note the call to **ALTER DATABASE SCOPED CONFIGURATION CLEAR PROCEDURE_CACHE** which recreates the plans of the queries impacted by the table schema change.

```sql
ALTER TABLE [dbo].[Employees]
ALTER COLUMN [SSN] [char] COLLATE Latin1_General_BIN2
ENCRYPTED WITH (COLUMN_ENCRYPTION_KEY = [CEK1], ENCRYPTION_TYPE = Randomized, ALGORITHM = 'AEAD_AES_256_CBC_HMAC_SHA_256') NOT NULL
WITH
(ONLINE = ON);
GO
ALTER DATABASE SCOPED CONFIGURATION CLEAR PROCEDURE_CACHE;
GO
```

### Make an existing encrypted column enclave-enabled

There are several ways to enable the enclave functionality for an existing column that isn't enclave-enabled. Which method you choose, depends on several factors:

- **Scope/granularity:** Do you want to enable the enclave functionality for a subset of columns, or for all columns protected with a given column master key?
- **Data size:** What is the size of the tables containing the column(s) you want to make enclave-enabled?
- Do you also want to change the encryption type for your column(s)? Remember that only randomized encryption supports rich computations (pattern matching, comparison operators). If your column is encrypted using deterministic encryption, you'll also need to re-encrypt it with randomized encryption to unlock the full functionality of the enclave.

Here are the three approaches for enabling enclaves for existing columns:

#### Option 1: Rotate the column master key to replace it with an enclave-enabled column master key.
  
- Pros:
  - Doesn't involve re-encrypting data, so it's typically the fastest approach. It's a recommended approach for columns containing large amounts of data, providing all columns, you need to enable rich computations for, already use deterministic encryption and, thus, do not need to be re-encrypted.
  - Can enable the enclave functionality for multiple columns at scale, as it makes all column encryption keys and all encrypted columns, associated with the original column master key, enclave-enabled.
  
- Cons:
  - Doesn't support changing the encryption type from deterministic to randomized, so while it unlocks in-place encryption for columns encrypted deterministically, it doesn't enable rich computations.
  - Doesn't allow you to selectively convert some of the columns, associated with a given column master key.
  - Introduces key management overhead - you need to create a new column master key and make it available to applications that query the impacted columns.  

#### Option 2: This approach involves two steps: 1) rotating the column master key (as in Option 1) and 2) re-encrypting a subset of deterministically encrypted columns using randomized encryption, to enable rich computations for those columns.
  
- Pros:
  - Re-encrypts data in-place, and thus it is a recommended method to enable rich queries for deterministically encrypted columns that contain large amounts of data. Step 1 unlocks in-place encryption for the columns using deterministic encryption, so step 2 can be performed in-place.
  - Can enable the enclave functionality for multiple columns at scale.
  
- Cons:
  - Doesn't allow you to selectively convert some of the columns, associated with a given column master key.
  - It introduces key management overhead - you need to create a new column master key and make it available to applications that query the impacted columns.

#### Option 3: Re-encrypting selected columns with a new enclave-enabled column encryption key and randomized encryption (if needed) on the client side.
  
- Pros - this method:
  - Allows you selectively to enable the enclave functionality for one column or a small subset of columns.
  - It can enable rich computations for a deterministically encrypted column in one step.
  - It doesn't require creating new column master key, so it has a smaller impact on applications.
  
- Cons:
  - The entire content of the table that contains the column needs to be moved outside of the database for re-encryption, so it is recommended only for small tables.

### Make columns enclave-enabled by rotating their Column Master Key

A column master key rotation is a process of replacing an existing column master key with a new column master key. It involves re-encrypting the column encryption keys, associated with the old column master key, using the new column master key. This workflow has existed since the initial release of Always Encrypted to support replacing a column master key for compliance or security reasons (in case the existing column master key gets compromised).

Always Encrypted using enclaves adds a new purpose for the column master key rotation workflow. Assuming the old column master key isn't enclave-enabled, and the new column master key is enclave-enabled, the rotation process effectively makes all column encryption keys, associated with the column master key, enclave-enabled. Rotating a column master key doesn't involve re-encrypting the data and, therefore, it's a recommended process for enabling enclave capabilities for existing columns.

Rotating the column master key doesn't change the encryption type of the impacted columns. Therefore, it can only unlock in-place encryption for columns encrypted deterministically. To unlock rich computations for columns using deterministic encryption, you need to re-encrypt them (in-place), after you rotate the column master key.

You may also need to change the collation for string columns, using randomized encryption, to a BIN2 collation, in order to unlock rich computations. See the Collation Setup section for details.

The process a column master key rotation is the same, regardless if either involved key is enclave-enabled. The details on how rotate the column master key is in the following articles:

- [Rotate a column master key with SSMS](configure-always-encrypted-using-sql-server-management-studio.md)
- [Rotating a column master key with PowerShell](rotate-always-encrypted-keys-using-powershell.md)

For your convenience, a sample PowerShell script for rotating a column master key is provided below.

#### Prerequisites of rotating the Column Master Key for enclave-enabled columns

- You have provisioned a new enclave-enabled column master key.
- You have access to both the old and the new column master key.
- All string columns, protected with the old column master key, use BIN2 collations.

> [!NOTE]
> Alternatively, you can change the collation of string columns after rotating the column master key.

#### Steps for rotating the Column Master Key for enclave-enabled columns

Paste the following script into Windows PowerShell ISE, replace the \<place holders\> with your specific values:

```powershell
# Import the SqlServer module.
Import-Module "SqlServer"

# Connect to your database. Modify server/db name or/and the connection string, if needed.
$serverName = "<server name>"
$databaseName = "<database name>"
$connStr = "Data Source = " + $serverName + "; Initial Catalog = " +
$databaseName + "; Integrated Security = true"
$database = Get-SqlDatabase -ConnectionString $connStr

# Set the names of the old/current column master key and the new/target enclave-enabled column master key. (Change the names, if needed).
$oldCmkName = "<old column master key name>"
$newCmkName = "<new column master key name>"

# Authenticate to Azure. Needed only of either column master key is stored in Azure Key Vault.
Add-SqlAzureAuthenticationContext -Interactive

# Initiate the rotation from the current column master key to the new column master key.
Invoke-SqlColumnMasterKeyRotation -SourceColumnMasterKeyName $oldCmkName
-TargetColumnMasterKeyName $newCmkName -InputObject $database

# Complete the rotation of the old column master key.
Complete-SqlColumnMasterKeyRotation -SourceColumnMasterKeyName
$oldCmkName -InputObject $database

# Remove the old column master key metadata.
Remove-SqlColumnMasterKey -Name $oldCmkName -InputObject $database
```


### Re-encrypt columns in-Place

After you have made your column enclave-enabled, you can perform the following operations in-place (inside the enclave, without having to move the data out of the database):

- Rotating the column encryption key (to replace it with a new key), for example, to adhere to compliance regulations, some of which mandate periodic key rotation, or for security reasons (in case your column encryption key gets compromised).
- Changing the encryption type, for example, from deterministic encryption to randomized encryption, to unlock rich computations for the column.

#### Prerequisites for re-encrypting columns in-place

- Your column is encrypted using an enclave-enabled column encryption key.
- You have provisioned a new enclave-enabled column encryption key (if your goal is to replace the current enclave-enabled column encryption key, protecting the column).
- You have access to the column master key.

#### Steps for re-encrypting columns in-place

1. Prepare an SSMS query window with Always Encrypted and enclave computations enabled for the database connection. For details, see [Prepare an SSMS Query Window with Always Encrypted Enabled](#prepare-an-ssms-query-window-with-always-encrypted-enabled).

2. In the query window, issue the use the [ALTER TABLE (Transact-SQL)](../../../t-sql/statements/alter-table-transact-sql.md) statement with the ALTER COLUMN clause, specifying the following in the ENCRYPTED WITH clause:
    
    1. The name of the new enclave-enabled column encryption key if you're rotating the current key. If you aren't changing the column encryption key, you need to specify the name of the current key.
    
    2. The new encryption type if you're changing it. If you're not changing the encryption type, you need to specify the current encryption type.
        
       If the column you're re-encrypting uses a collation (BIN2) that is different than the default database collation, you need to include the COLLATE phrase and specify the current column collation in the column definition (to keep the collation the same).
        
       > [!NOTE]
       > If your column master key is stored in Azure Key Vault, you might be prompted to sign in to Azure.

3. Clear the plan cache for all batches and stored procedures that access the table, to refresh parameters encryption information. 
 
    ```sql
    ALTER DATABASE SCOPED CONFIGURATION CLEAR PROCEDURE_CACHE;
    ```
    > [!NOTE]
    > If you do not remove the plan for the impacted query from the cache, the first execution of the query after encryption may fail.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Use ALTER DATABASE SCOPED CONFIGURATION CLEAR PROCEDURE_CACHE or DBCC FREEPROCCACHE to clear the plan cache carefully, as it may result in temporary query performance degradation. To minimize the negative impact of clearing the cache, you can selectively remove the plans for the impacted queries only.

4.  Call [sp_refresh_parameter_encryption](../../system-stored-procedures/sp-refresh-parameter-encryption-transact-sql.md) to update the metadata for the parameters of each module (stored procedure, function, view, trigger) that are persisted in [sys.parameters](../..//system-catalog-views/sys-parameters-transact-sql.md) and may have been invalidated by re-encrypting the columns.

#### Examples of re-encrypting columns in-place

Assuming the SSN column currently is encrypted using an enclave-enabled column encryption key, named CEK1, and deterministic encryption, and the current collation, set at the column level is Latin1\_General\_BIN2, the below statement re-encrypts the column with randomized encrypted and the same key.

```sql
ALTER TABLE [dbo].[Employees]
ALTER COLUMN [SSN] [char](11) COLLATE Latin1_General_BIN2
ENCRYPTED WITH (COLUMN_ENCRYPTION_KEY = [CEK1]
, ENCRYPTION_TYPE = Randomized
, ALGORITHM = 'AEAD_AES_256_CBC_HMAC_SHA_256') NOT NULL;
GO
ALTER DATABASE SCOPED CONFIGURATION CLEAR PROCEDURE_CACHE;
GO
```

Assuming the SSN column currently is encrypted using an enclave-enabled column encryption key, named CEK1, and deterministic encryption, and the default database collation is a BIN2 collation (and it hasn't been set at the column level), the below statement re-encrypts the column with a new enclave-enabled key, named CEK2 (without changing the encryption type).

```sql
ALTER TABLE [dbo].[Employees]
ALTER COLUMN [SSN] [char](11) 
ENCRYPTED WITH (COLUMN_ENCRYPTION_KEY = [CEK2]
, ENCRYPTION\_TYPE = Deterministic
, ALGORITHM = 'AEAD_AES_256_CBC_HMAC_SHA_256') NOT NULL;
GO
ALTER DATABASE SCOPED CONFIGURATION CLEAR PROCEDURE_CACHE;
GO
```

Assuming the SSN column currently is encrypted using an enclave-enabled column encryption key named CEK1, deterministic encryption, and the default database collation is a BIN2 collation (and it hasn't been set at the column level), the below statement re-encrypts the column with a new enclave-enabled key and randomized encryption. In addition, the operation is performed in the online mode.

```sql
ALTER TABLE [dbo].[Employees]
ALTER COLUMN [SSN] [char](11) 
ENCRYPTED WITH (COLUMN_ENCRYPTION_KEY = [CEK1]
, ENCRYPTION_TYPE = Randomized
, ALGORITHM = 'AEAD_AES_256_CBC_HMAC_SHA_256') NOT NULL 
WITH (ONLINE = ON);
GO
ALTER DATABASE SCOPED CONFIGURATION CLEAR PROCEDURE_CACHE;
GO
```

### Re-encrypt columns on the client side

The legacy method for re-encrypting (and encrypting or decrypting) columns uses client-side tools, such as the Always Encrypted wizard or PowerShell. In general, using this method isn't recommended, except if the table containing the columns (being re-encrypted) is small and if your goal is to combine re-encrypting a column with a new enclave-enabled key and changing the encryption type (from deterministic to randomized).

If you re-encrypt a column uses randomized encryption, you may need to change its collation to a BIN2 collation (before or after re-encrypting), to unlock rich computations. See the Collation Setup section for details.

For details, see:

  - Rotating column encryption keys using SSMS:
    <https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/relational-databases/security/encryption/always-encrypted-wizard>
  - Rotating column encryption keys using PowerShell:
    <https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/relational-databases/security/encryption/configure-column-encryption-using-powershell>

### Decrypt a column in-place

If your column is encrypted with an enclave-enabled column encryption
key, you can decrypt it (convert to a plaintext column) in-place, using
the ALTER TABLE statement. In addition, the operation is performed in
the online mode.

#### Prerequisites for decrypting a column in-place

- Your column is encrypted using an enclave-enabled column encryption key.
- You have access to the column master key.

#### Steps for decrypting a column in-place

1. Prepare an SSMS query window with Always Encrypted and enclave computations enabled for the database connection. For details, see [Prepare an SSMS Query Window with Always Encrypted Enabled](#prepare-an-ssms-query-window-with-always-encrypted-enabled).

2. In the query window, issue the [ALTER TABLE (Transact-SQL)](../../../t-sql/statements/alter-table-transact-sql.md) statement with the ALTER COLUMN clause, specifying the desired column configuration **without** the ENCRYPTED WITH clause.
    
    > [!NOTE]
    > If your column master key is stored in Azure Key Vault, you might be prompted to sign in to Azure.

3. Clear the plan cache for all batches and stored procedures that access the table, to refresh parameters encryption information. 

    ```sql
    ALTER DATABASE SCOPED CONFIGURATION CLEAR PROCEDURE_CACHE;
    ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you do not remove the plan for the impacted query from the cache, the first execution of the query after encryption may fail.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Use ALTER DATABASE SCOPED CONFIGURATION CLEAR PROCEDURE_CACHE or DBCC FREEPROCCACHE to clear the plan cache carefully, as it may result in temporary query performance degradation. To minimize the negative impact of clearing the cache, you can selectively remove the plans for the impacted queries only.

4. Call [sp_refresh_parameter_encryption](../../system-stored-procedures/sp-refresh-parameter-encryption-transact-sql.md) to update the metadata for the parameters of each module (stored procedure, function, view, trigger) that are persisted in [sys.parameters](../..//system-catalog-views/sys-parameters-transact-sql.md) and may have been invalidated by decrypting the columns.

#### Example for decrypting a column in-place

Assuming the SSN column is encrypted and the current collation, set at the column level is Latin1\_General\_BIN2, the below statement decrypts the column (and keep the collation unchanged - alternatively, you can choose to change the collation, for example, to a non-BIN2 collation in the same statement).

```sql
ALTER TABLE [dbo].[Employees]
ALTER COLUMN [SSN] [char](11) COLLATE Latin1_General_BIN2
WITH (ONLINE = ON);
GO
ALTER DATABASE SCOPED CONFIGURATION CLEAR PROCEDURE_CACHE;
GO
```

## Issue Rich Queries against encrypted columns using SSMS

The quickest way to try rich queries against your enclave-enabled columns is from an SSMS query window with Parameterization for Always Encrypted enabled. For details on this useful capability in SSMS, see:

- [Parameterization for Always Encrypted - Using SSMS to Insert into, Update and Filter by Encrypted Columns](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/sqlsecurity/2016/12/13/parameterization-for-always-encrypted-using-ssms-to-insert-into-update-and-filter-by-encrypted-columns/)
- [Querying Encrypted Columns](configure-always-encrypted-using-sql-server-management-studio.md#querying-encrypted-columns)

### Prerequisites for issuing Rich Queries against encrypted columns using SSMS

- The columns to query, are enclave-enabled.
- You have access to the column master key (or keys).

### Steps for issuing Rich Queries against encrypted columns using SSMS

1. Prepare an SSMS query window with Always Encrypted and enclave computations enabled for the database connection. For details, see [Prepare an SSMS Query Window with Always Encrypted Enabled](#prepare-an-ssms-query-window-with-always-encrypted-enabled).

2. Enable Parameterization for Always Encrypted.

    1. Select **Query** from the main menu of SSMS.
    2. Select **Query Options...**.
    3. Navigate to **Execution** > **Advanced**.
    4. Select or unselect Enable Parameterization for Always Encrypted.
    5. Click OK.

3. Author and execute your queries using rich computations on encrypted columns. You need to declare a Transact-SQL variable for each value targeting an encrypted column in your query. The variables must use inline initializations (can't be set via the SET statement).

    > [!NOTE]
    > If your column master key is stored in Azure Key Vault, you might be prompted to sign in to Azure.

### Example of Rich Queries against encrypted columns

This example assumes your database contains a table created using the following statement.

```sql
CREATE TABLE [dbo].[Employees]
(
    [EmployeeID] [int] IDENTITY(1,1) NOT NULL,
    [SSN] [char](11) COLLATE Latin1_General_BIN2 ENCRYPTED WITH (
        COLUMN_ENCRYPTION_KEY = [CEK1],
        ENCRYPTION_TYPE = Randomized,
        ALGORITHM = 'AEAD_AES_256_CBC_HMAC_SHA_256') NOT NULL,
    [FirstName] [nvarchar](50) NOT NULL,
    [LastName] [nvarchar](50) NOT NULL,
    [Salary] [money] ENCRYPTED WITH (
        COLUMN_ENCRYPTION_KEY = [CEK1],
        ENCRYPTION_TYPE = Randomized,
        ALGORITHM = 'AEAD_AES_256_CBC_HMAC_SHA_256') NOT NULL,
    CONSTRAINT [PK_dbo.Employees] PRIMARY KEY CLUSTERED (
[EmployeeID] ASC
)
) ON [PRIMARY];
GO
```

CEK1 is an enclave-enabled column encryption key.

Here is an example of a query that adheres to the guidelines for parameterization, against that table:

```sql
DECLARE @SSNPattern [char](11) = '%1111%'
DECLARE @MinSalary [money] = 1000
SELECT *
FROM [dbo].[Employees]
WHERE SSN LIKE @SSNPattern
    AND [Salary] >= @MinSalary;
GO;
```

## Create and use indexes on enclave-enabled columns using randomized encryption

Because an index on an enclave-enabled column using randomized encryption stores the encrypted index key values while the values are sorted based on plaintext, SQL Server Engine must use the enclave for any operation that involves creating or updating an index, including:

- Creating or rebuilding an index.
- Inserting, updating, or deleting a row in the table (containing an indexed/encrypted column), which triggers inserting or/and removing an index key to/from the index.
- Running DBCC commands that involve checking the integrity of indexes, for example [DBCC CHECKDB (Transact-SQL)](../../../t-sql/database-console-commands/dbcc-checkdb-transact-sql.md) or [DBCC CHECKTABLE (Transact-SQL)](../../../t-sql/database-console-commands/dbcc-checktable-transact-sql.md).
- Database recovery (for example, after SQL Server fails and restarts), if SQL Server needs to undo any changes to the index (see more details below).

All the above operations require the enclave has the column encryption key for the indexed column, so that it can decrypt the index keys. In general, the enclave can obtain a column encryption key in one of two ways:
- Directly from the client application.
- From the cache of column encryption keys.

### Invoke indexing operations with column encryption keys provided directly by the client

For this method for invoking indexing operations to work, the application issuing a query that triggers an operation on an index must:

- Connect to the database with both Always Encrypted and enclave computations enabled in the database connection.
- The application must have access to the column master key protecting the column encryption key for the indexed column.

Once SQL Server Engine parses the application query and it determines it will need to update an index on an encrypted column to execute the query, it instructs the client driver to provide the required CEK to the enclave over a secure channel. Note this is exactly the same mechanism that is used to provide the enclave with column encryption keys for processing queries that don't involve indexing operations.

This method is useful to ensure the presence of indexes on encrypted columns is transparent to applications that already connect to the database with Always Encrypted and enclave computations enabled for the connection and use the enclave for query processing. After you create an index on a column, the driver inside your app will transparently provide column encryption keys to the enclave for indexing operations. Note that creating indexes may increase the number of queries that require the application to send the column encryption keys to the enclave.

For step-by-step instructions on how to use this method, see [Tutorial: Creating and using indexes on enclave-enabled columns using randomized encryption](../tutorial-creating-using-indexes-on-enclave-enabled-columns-using-randomized-encryption.md).

### Invoke indexing operations using cached column encryption keys

Once a client application sends a column encryption key to the enclave (for processing any query that requires enclave computations), the enclave caches the column encryption key in an internal cache (located inside the enclave and inaccessible from the outside).

If the same or another client application (used by the same or a different user) triggers an operation on an index without providing the required column encryption directly, the enclave will look up the column encryption key in the cache. As a result, the operation on the index succeeds, although the client application hasn't provided the key.

For this method of invoking indexing operations to work, the application must connect to the database without Always Encrypted enabled for the connection and the required column encryption key must be available in the cache inside the enclave.

This method of invoking operations is supported only for queries that do not require column encryption keys for other operations, not related to indexes. For example, an application inserting a row using an INSERT statement to a table that contains an encrypted column, is required to connect to the database with Always Encrypted enabled in the connection string and it must have access to the keys, regardless if the encrypted column has an index or not.

This method is useful to:

- Ensure the presence of indexes on enclave-enabled columns using randomized encryption is transparent to applications and users that don't have access to the keys and the data in plaintext. It ensures creating an index on an encrypted column doesn't brake existing queries, that is, if an application issues a query on a table containing encrypted columns without having to have access to the keys, the application can continue to run without having access to the keys after a DBA creates an index. For example, consider an application that runs the below query on the **Employees** table used in the previous example, before a DBA creates an index on any encrypted column. 

   ```sql
   DELETE FROM [dbo].[Employees] WHERE [EmployeeID] = 1;
   GO
   ```

   If the application submits the query over a connection without Always Encrypted and enclave computations enabled, the query will succeed, as it does not trigger any computations on encrypted columns. After a DBA creates an index on any encrypted columns, the query triggers the removal of index keys from indexes, which the enclave needs the column encryption keys for. However, the application will be able to continue to run this query over the same connection, as long as a data owner has supplied the column encryption keys to the enclave.

- To achieve role separation when managing indexes, as it enables DBAs to create and alter indexes on encrypted columns, without having access to sensitive data. 

For step-by-step instructions on how to use this method, see [Tutorial: Creating and using indexes on enclave-enabled columns using randomized encryption](../tutorial-creating-using-indexes-on-enclave-enabled-columns-using-randomized-encryption.md).

## Develop Applications issuing Rich Queries in Visual Studio

### Set up your Visual Studio Project

To use Always Encrypted with secure enclaves in a .NET Framework application, you need to make sure your application is built against .NET Framework 4.7.2 and is integrated with the [Microsoft.SqlServer.Management.AlwaysEncrypted.EnclaveProviders NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.SqlServer.Management.AlwaysEncrypted.EnclaveProviders). In addition, if you store you column master key in Azure Key Vault, you also need to integrate your application with the [Microsoft.SqlServer.Management.AlwaysEncrypted.AzureKeyVaultProvider NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.SqlServer.Management.AlwaysEncrypted.AzureKeyVaultProvider), version 2.2.0 or later. 

1. Open Visual Studio.
2. Create a new Visual C\# project, or open an existing project.
3. Make sure your project targets at least .NET Framework 4.7.2. Right-click on the project in Solution Explorer, select Properties and set Target framework to .NET Framework 4.7.2.

4. Install the following NuGet package by going to **Tools** (main menu) > **NuGet Package Manager** > **Package Manager Console**. Run the following code in the Package Manager Console.

   ```powershell
   Install-Package Microsoft.SqlServer.Management.AlwaysEncrypted.EnclaveProviders -IncludePrerelease
   ```

5. If you use Azure Key Vault for storing your column master keys, install the following NuGet packages by going to **Tools** (main menu) > **NuGet Package Manager** > **Package Manager Console**. Run the following code in the Package Manager Console.

   ```powershell
   Install-Package Microsoft.SqlServer.Management.AlwaysEncrypted.AzureKeyVaultProvider -IncludePrerelease -Version 2.2.0
   Install-Package Microsoft.IdentityModel.Clients.ActiveDirectory
   ```

6. Select your project and click Install.
7. Open the configuration file from your project (for example, App.config or Web.config).
8. Locate the \<configuration\> section and add or update the \<configSections\> sections.

   a. If the \<configuration\> section does **not** contain the \<configSections\> section, add the following content immediatelly below \<configuration\>.
   
      ```xml
      <configSections>
         <section name="SqlColumnEncryptionEnclaveProviders" type="System.Data.SqlClient.SqlColumnEncryptionEnclaveProviderConfigurationSection, System.Data, Version=4.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b77a5c561934e089" />
      </configSections>
      ```
   b. If the \<configruation\> section already contains the \<configSections\> section, add the following line within the \<configSections\>:

   ```xml
   <section name="SqlColumnEncryptionEnclaveProviders"  type="System.Data.SqlClient.SqlColumnEncryptionEnclaveProviderConfigurationSection, System.Data,  Version=4.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b77a5c561934e089" /\>
   ```

9. Inside the configuration section, below the \<configSections\>, add the following section, which specific an enclave provider to be used to attest and interact with VBS enclaves:

   ```xml
   <SqlColumnEncryptionEnclaveProviders>
       <providers>
           <add name="VBS"  type="Microsoft.SqlServer.Management.AlwaysEncrypted.EnclaveProviders.VirtualizationBasedSecurityEnclaveProvider,  Microsoft.SqlServer.Management.AlwaysEncrypted.EnclaveProviders,    Version=15.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=89845dcd8080cc91"/>
       </providers>
   </SqlColumnEncryptionEnclaveProviders>
   ```

Here is a complete example of an app.config file for a simple console application.
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>
<configuration>
  <configSections>
    <section name="SqlColumnEncryptionEnclaveProviders" type="System.Data.SqlClient.SqlColumnEncryptionEnclaveProviderConfigurationSection, System.Data, Version=4.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b77a5c561934e089" />
  </configSections>
  <startup> 
        <supportedRuntime version="v4.0" sku=".NETFramework,Version=v4.7.2" />
    </startup>

  <SqlColumnEncryptionEnclaveProviders>
    <providers>
      <add name="VBS" type="Microsoft.SqlServer.Management.AlwaysEncrypted.EnclaveProviders.HostGuardianServiceEnclaveProvider, Microsoft.SqlServer.Management.AlwaysEncrypted.EnclaveProviders, Version=15.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=89845dcd8080cc91" />
    </providers>
  </SqlColumnEncryptionEnclaveProviders>
</configuration>
```
### Develop and test your app

To use Always Encrypted and enclave computations, your application needs to connect to the database with the following two keywords in the connection string: `Column Encryption Setting = Enabled; Enclave Attestation Url=https://x.x.x.x/Attestation` (where xxxx can be an ip, domain, etc.).

In addition, your application needs to adhere to common guidelines that apply to applications using Always Encrypted, for example, your application must have access to column master keys associated with the database columns, referenced in application queries.

For details on developing .NET Framework Applications using Always Encrypted, see the following articles:

- [Develop using Always Encrypted with .NET Framework Data Provider](develop-using-always-encrypted-with-net-framework-data-provider.md)
- [Always Encrypted: Protect sensitive data in SQL Database and store your encryption keys in Azure Key Vault](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/sql-database-always-encrypted)

#### Example of simple application

The below code is a simple example of a C\# console app issuing a LIKE query against the table with the following schema:

```sql
CREATE TABLE [dbo].[Employees]
(
    [EmployeeID] [int] IDENTITY(1,1) NOT NULL,
    [SSN] [char](11) ENCRYPTED WITH (
        COLUMN_ENCRYPTION_KEY = [CEK1],
        ENCRYPTION_TYPE = Randomized,
        ALGORITHM = 'AEAD_AES_256_CBC_HMAC_SHA_256') NOT NULL,
    [FirstName] [nvarchar](50) NOT NULL,
    [LastName] [nvarchar](50) NOT NULL,
    [Salary] [money] ENCRYPTED WITH (
        COLUMN_ENCRYPTION_KEY = [CEK1],
        ENCRYPTION_TYPE = Randomized,
        ALGORITHM = 'AEAD_AES_256_CBC_HMAC_SHA_256') NOT NULL,
    CONSTRAINT [PK_dbo.Employees] PRIMARY KEY CLUSTERED (
[EmployeeID] ASC
)
) ON [PRIMARY];
GO
```

CEK1 is assumed to be an enclave-enabled column encryption key.
